            <p> Lex Rule is a Hood River musician and singer-songwriter. Originally from Ventura, California, she fell in love with music at the age of 12 when she received her first guitar. The next few years consisted of teaching herself to play by ear, reading tabs, and watching YouTube tutorials before overcoming stage fright and performing acoustically for the crowds of local talent shows and coffee shops. Inspired by singer-songwriter musicians like Norah Jones and John Mayer, writing songs became her favorite after school past time. </p>

            <p> She picked up the electric guitar at 17, and spent that year gigging with her then backing band, The Line Up. Lex Rule and The Line-Up impressed Ventura audiences of all ages with their eclectic sets that included a blues classic, a Nirvana cover and Lex's original songs. After scratching the surfaces of multiple genres, Lex is settling into a smooth blend of Light Rock and Soul music that she is eager to share with new listeners. </p>

            <p> Since moving to Oregon a few years ago, Lex has been fitting into the booming scene of independent music artists just fine. With her soulful voice, melodic guitar playing, and honest lyrics, she has captivated audiences at cafe’s, breweries, wineries and farmer’s markets across the Gorge. </p>

            <p> She is currently writing her debut EP which she will release later this year. Stay up to date on Lex's upcoming projects and shows by liking her page on Facebook!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LexRuleMusic/">Facebook!</a></p>
